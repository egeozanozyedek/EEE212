# EEE212

All codes were written by me (Ege Ozan Özyedek) in collaboration with my dear friend/lab partner Şevki Gavrem Kulkuloğlu.

Assembly codes from my microprocessors course. Written in 8051 Assembly using the Atmel 8052 microcontroller.
Includes on and off labs. Off labs are much more comprehensive (such as serial comminication between two microprocessors
or using ADC to convert an analog signal into a digital one and then processing that signal) and on labs are to test the 
time efficiency of the code writer (some labs include using a DAC to output an analog signal from a port of the microcontroller
or blinking a led in a determined frequency).
